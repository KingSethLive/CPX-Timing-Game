# CPX-Timing-Game
The aim of the game is to stop the red pixel inbetween the two green pixels. You can stop the pixel by clicking either of the buttons. Each time you do it correctly, the game will flash green and continue faster and the score will be printed and increased by one. If you fail, a sound will play and red lights will flash. Then the game and the score will start back at the beginning.
